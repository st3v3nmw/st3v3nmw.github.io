{{<epigraph pre="John Koenig, " cite="The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows">}}
vemödalen (n.) the frustration of photographing something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist—the same sunset, the same waterfall, the same curve of a hip, the same closeup of an eye—which can turn a unique subject into something hollow and pulpy and cheap, like a mass-produced piece of furniture you happen to have assembled yourself.

I recently came across the word _vemödalen_ {{<marginnote>}} Pronounced "vey-moh-dah-len."{{</marginnote>}} while reading John Koenig's phenomenal work titled _The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows_. Vemödalen is _the fear that originality is no longer possible_ and for a person who has been mulling over the idea of starting _yet another_ blog, I couldn't think of a better first post. Why start a new one when everything has already been "done"?

Answer:<br/>
That you are here—that life exists and identity,<br/>
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.
