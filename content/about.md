Hi, I'm Stephen!

I'm a Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya.
I'm currently doing backend development in Golang & Python at work,
_casually_ writing some [TypeScript](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition),
and learning distributed systems & machine learning.
Before that, I received a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Nairobi.

I also maintain and contribute to various open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/).

_Occasionally_, I [write at length](/blog) about things I find interesting — and, as a proud Oxford comma enthusiast, I’ll always list things correctly!

Feel free to reach out to me at _&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#032;[&#097;&#116;]&#032;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#112;&#104;&#101;&#110;&#109;&#119;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#105;&#032;[&#100;&#111;&#116;]&#032;&#099;&#111;&#109;_ — I’d love to hear from you!
