Hi, I'm Stephen!

I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Scientist based in Nairobi, Kenya.
I'm currently doing backend development in Django/PostgreSQL at work,
_casually_ writing some [TypeScript](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) & Rust,
and learning Go & Site Reliability Engineering.
Before that, I received a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Nairobi.

I also maintain and contribute to various open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/).
_Occasionally_, I [write at length](/posts) about things I find interesting.

Feel free to send me an email on _&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#032;[&#097;&#116;]&#032;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#112;&#104;&#101;&#110;&#109;&#119;&#097;&#110;&#103;&#105;&#032;[&#100;&#111;&#116;]&#032;&#099;&#111;&#109;._
